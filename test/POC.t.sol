    // Here's an attack vector that we wanted to highlight.
    // In Uniswap V3, where NonFungiblePositionManager is used to represent LP positions as NFTs,
    // anyone can increase the liquidity of a position even if the NFT is not owned by them.
    // An attacker can mint an LP position, wrap it using UniswapV3Wrapper, partially unwrap all but 1 wei of ERC6909 tokens.
    // At this point, the NFT will still be held by the UniswapV3Wrapper, but the attacker can now increase the liquidity of the position
    // and enable it as collateral.
    // So, this 1 wei of ERC6909 token now represents a large amount of collateral.
    // They can borrow against this collateral and take advantage of a rounding error if we missed anything.
    // We round up in liquidator's favor to avoid any issues with liquidator receiving less than expected, but there can be something we missed.
    // You can pick this up from where we left off and try to exploit this vector.
    // UniswapV4Wrapper doesn't have this potential issue as PositionManager doesn't allow anyone to increase liquidity of a position they don't own.
    // Users have to unwrap the entire position to get back the NFT and then they can increase liquidity, and when they wrap again, they always get minted FULL_AMOUNT of ERC6909 tokens.
